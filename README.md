If you use much container objects, on which the user has access (For example admin users), the main menu may will confused, and the display much main menu items

### Known issues

#### Lost main menu items

May some lost items will stay in the main menu administration, if you change the position of children or delete children

If you delete container objects or areas from the plugin or uninstall the plugin, the main menu items are automatic clean up

Otherwise, you can ignore the lost main menu items because not viewed in the menu or delete it manually

The plugin has a manual action too for delete lost menu items of the plugin, which is more advanced than the core action is

### Custom event plugins

If you need to adapt some custom SrContainerObjectMenu changes which can not be configured to your needs, SrContainerObjectMenu will trigger some events, you can listen and react to this in an other custom plugin (plugin type is no matter)

First create or extend a `plugin.xml` in your custom plugin (You need to adapt `PLUGIN_ID` with your own plugin id) to tell ILIAS, your plugins wants to listen to SrContainerObjectMenu events (You need also to increase your plugin version for take effect)

```xml
<?php xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<plugin id="PLUGIN_ID">
	<events>
		<event id="Plugins/SrContainerObjectMenu" type="listen" />
	</events>
</plugin>
```

In your plugin class implement or extend the `handleEvent` method

```php
...
require_once __DIR__ . "/../../SrContainerObjectMenu/vendor/autoload.php";
...
class ilXPlugin extends ...
...
	/**
	 * @inheritDoc
	 */
	public function handleEvent(/*string*/ $a_component, /*string*/ $a_event, /*array*/ $a_parameter)/* : void*/ {
		switch ($a_component) {
			case IL_COMP_PLUGIN . "/" . ilSrContainerObjectMenuPlugin::PLUGIN_NAME:
				switch ($a_event) {
					case ilSrContainerObjectMenuPlugin::EVENT_...:
						...
						break;

					default:
						break;
				}
				break;

			default:
				break;
		}
	}
...
```

| Event | Parameters | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `ilSrContainerObjectMenuPlugin::EVENT_CHANGE_MENU_ENTRY` | `entry => &AbstractBaseItem`<br>`obj_id => int` | Change menu entry (Please note `entry` is a reference variable, if it should not works) |
